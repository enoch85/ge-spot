# ENTSO-E API Integration Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the ENTSO-E API integration in the GE-Spot project.

## Overview

The ENTSO-E API integration was experiencing issues with several regions not returning data. After investigation, it was discovered that many regions required different EIC codes than what was originally used. By analyzing the EIC map from ENTSO-E and systematically testing different codes, we were able to significantly improve the success rate of the API integration.

## Improvements Made

1. **Updated EIC Codes**: Identified and updated EIC codes for multiple regions:
   - Nordic regions (SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4, NO1, NO2, NO3, NO4)
   - Baltic states (EE)
   - Italy regions (IT-Sardinia, IT-Sicily, IT-North, IT-Centre-South, IT-South)
   - Balkans (ME, RS)
   - Great Britain (GB) - now using the same code as Ireland (IE/SEM)

2. **Enhanced API Client**:
   - Added support for multiple document types (A44, A62, A65)
   - Improved error handling and response parsing
   - Added more robust API key validation
   - Enhanced date range handling to try multiple ranges

3. **Testing Tools**:
   - Created enhanced testing script to verify EIC codes
   - Developed comprehensive test script to validate all regions
   - Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Current Status

The success rate has improved from less than 50% to 80% (40 out of 50 regions now working).

### Working Regions (40/50)

- **Nordic Regions (12/15)**:
  - Denmark (DK1, DK2)
  - Estonia (EE)
  - Finland (FI)
  - Norway (NO1, NO2, NO3, NO4)
  - Sweden (SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4)
  - *Not working*: Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Norway West (NO5)

- **Central Europe (6/6)**:
  - Austria (AT)
  - Belgium (BE)
  - France (FR)
  - Germany-Luxembourg (DE-LU)
  - Netherlands (NL)
  - Switzerland (CH)

- **Southern Europe (9/11)**:
  - Greece (GR)
  - Italy (IT, IT-North, IT-Centre-South, IT-South, IT-Sardinia, IT-Sicily)
  - Portugal (PT)
  - Spain (ES)
  - *Not working*: Italy Centre-North, Cyprus (CY)

- **Eastern Europe (8/8)**:
  - Bulgaria (BG)
  - Croatia (HR)
  - Czech Republic (CZ)
  - Hungary (HU)
  - Poland (PL)
  - Romania (RO)
  - Slovakia (SK)
  - Slovenia (SI)

- **Balkans (3/5)**:
  - Montenegro (ME)
  - North Macedonia (MK)
  - Serbia (RS)
  - *Not working*: Albania (AL), Bosnia and Herzegovina (BA)

- **Other Regions (2/5)**:
  - Great Britain (GB)
  - Ireland/Northern Ireland (IE/SEM)
  - *Not working*: Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), Ukraine-West (UA-BEI)

## Remaining Issues

Despite extensive testing with various EIC code combinations, there are still 10 regions that couldn't be fixed:

1. **Latvia (LV)** and **Lithuania (LT)**: Tried multiple EIC codes but none worked.
2. **Norway West (NO5)**: Tried pattern-based codes but none worked.
3. **Italy Centre-North**: The estimated code doesn't work.
4. **Balkans**: Albania (AL) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BA) don't work.
5. **Other regions**: Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), Ukraine-West (UA-BEI), and Cyprus (CY) don't work.

These regions may require:
- Different API parameters or configurations
- Special handling for certain regions
- Alternative data sources (e.g. Nordpool for Nordic regions)

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **For the remaining problematic regions**:
   - Implement fallback to Nordpool API for Nordic regions (NO5, LV, LT)
   - Research alternative data sources for other regions
   - Monitor ENTSO-E API changes that might make these regions available in the future

2. **General improvements**:
   - Implement periodic validation of EIC codes to detect changes
   - Add more detailed logging for API responses to help diagnose issues
   - Consider caching successful EIC codes to improve performance

## Testing

To test the ENTSO-E API integration, use the following scripts:

1. `scripts/test_all_entsoe_regions.py`: Tests all regions with the updated EIC codes
2. `scripts/enhanced_entsoe_test.py`: Tests specific regions with multiple EIC code combinations
3. `scripts/test_remaining_regions.py`: Focuses on testing the problematic regions

## Conclusion

The ENTSO-E API integration has been significantly improved, with 80% of regions now working correctly. The remaining regions may require alternative approaches or data sources. The enhanced API client is now more robust and can handle a wider variety of API responses, making it more reliable for fetching electricity price data across Europe.
