"""
Unit tests for GE Spot.

This directory contains unit tests that test individual components in isolation.
These tests use mocks for dependencies to ensure they are true unit tests.

The tests can be run with pytest:
    pytest tests/unit/

These tests are focused on testing the internal logic of components without
making any external API calls or interacting with the file system.
