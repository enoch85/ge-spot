# Integration Test Fixes - Completed

## Changes Made

All integration tests have been updated to use `normalize_interval_prices()` instead of `normalize_hourly_prices()`.

### Files Updated

1. ✅ **nordpool_full_chain.py** (line 463)
   - Changed from: `normalize_hourly_prices()`
   - Changed to: `normalize_interval_prices()`
   - Expected: ~192 intervals (96 per day × 2 days, 15-minute intervals)

2. ✅ **aemo_full_chain.py** (line 156)
   - Changed from: `tz_service.normalize_hourly_prices()`
   - Changed to: `tz_converter.normalize_interval_prices()`
   - Added TimezoneConverter import
   - Expected: ~192 intervals (5-min aggregated to 15-min)

3. ✅ **comed_full_chain.py** (line 143)
   - Changed from: `normalize_hourly_prices()`
   - Changed to: `normalize_interval_prices()`
   - Expected: ~192 intervals (5-min aggregated to 15-min)

4. ✅ **epex_full_chain.py** (line 167)
   - Changed from: `normalize_hourly_prices()`
   - Changed to: `normalize_interval_prices()`
   - Expected: ~192 intervals (15-minute native support)

5. ✅ **amber_full_chain.py** (line 171)
   - Changed from: `normalize_hourly_prices()`
   - Changed to: `normalize_interval_prices()`
   - Expected: Depends on Amber API (possibly 30-min or hourly)

6. ✅ **entsoe_full_chain.py** (line 185)
   - Changed from: `normalize_hourly_prices()`
   - Changed to: `normalize_interval_prices()`
   - Expected: ~192 intervals (15-minute native support)

7. ✅ **omie_full_chain.py** (line 162)
   - Changed from: `normalize_hourly_prices()`
   - Changed to: `normalize_interval_prices()`
   - Expected: ~48 intervals (OMIE provides hourly data only)

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Tests were aggregating 15-minute intervals to hourly
- Tests showed 24-48 hourly intervals per day
- Tests gave false impression that APIs only provided hourly data

### After Fix
- Tests now preserve 15-minute intervals
- Tests show true granularity: 96 intervals per day (15-min)
- Tests accurately reflect API capabilities

## Expected Test Output

| Source | Interval Type | Expected Count (2 days) | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|-------|
| NordPool | 15-min | ~192 | Native 15-min support |
| AEMO | 5-min → 15-min | ~192 | Aggregated 5→15 min |
| ComEd | 5-min → 15-min | ~192 | Aggregated 5→15 min |
| ENTSOE | 15-min | ~192 | Native 15-min support |
| EPEX | 15-min | ~192 | Native 15-min support |
| Amber | TBD | TBD | API interval varies |
| OMIE | Hourly | ~48 | Hourly only |

## Verification

To verify the fixes work correctly, run any integration test:

```bash
# NordPool (confirmed working)
python tests/manual/integration/nordpool_full_chain.py SE3 --no-cache

# ENTSOE
python tests/manual/integration/entsoe_full_chain.py SE --no-cache

# AEMO
python tests/manual/integration/aemo_full_chain.py NSW --no-cache

# etc.
```

Expected output should show:
- ✅ "After normalization: 192 price points" (or similar)
- ✅ Display of 15-minute intervals (e.g., 00:00, 00:15, 00:30, 00:45)
- ✅ "✓ CONFIRMED: API is providing 15-minute interval data"

## Important Notes

### Test Limitations
While these fixes make the tests **show the correct 15-minute data**, the tests are still:
- ❌ Not testing production code (DataProcessor)
- ❌ Reimplementing production logic
- ❌ Can pass while production code is broken

### Future Work
For proper integration testing, tests should:
1. Call the API
2. Call **DataProcessor.process()** (production code)
3. Validate the output

See `INTEGRATION_TEST_FIXES.md` for details on proper refactoring (Option A).
