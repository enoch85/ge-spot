# Debug Log Analysis - Issues Found

## Critical Issue: Tomorrow-Only Data Rejected

### Timeline of Events

**23:49:56** - Successful API fetch and processing
- ✅ API fetched 96 intervals from ENTSO-E
- ✅ Parser extracted all 96 prices starting at 22:00 UTC (00:00 Stockholm = Oct 3)
- ✅ Timezone conversion completed: 96 prices for Oct 3
- ✅ Split completed: 0 today (Oct 2), 96 tomorrow (Oct 3)
- ✅ Data processor completed successfully
- ❌ **unified_price_manager REJECTED the data**

**Error:** `[SE4] Failed to process fetched data. Error: Processing failed to produce valid data`

**Root Cause:** Line 382 in `unified_price_manager.py`
```python
if processed_data and processed_data.get("has_data") and processed_data.get("interval_prices"):
```

This check has TWO bugs:
1. `processed_data.get("has_data")` - this key doesn't exist, always returns `None`/falsy
2. `processed_data.get("interval_prices")` - requires today's prices, but we only have tomorrow's

**Result:** Data was never cached, leaving the system with no data.

---

## Cascade Effect: Midnight Failure

**00:00:06** - Midnight transition
- System looks for today's data (Oct 3)
- Cache manager checks yesterday's (Oct 2) cache for tomorrow data
- ❌ **No cache exists** (because it was rejected at 23:49:56)
- System has NO DATA despite having fetched valid tomorrow prices 10 minutes ago

---

## Secondary Issue: `has_data` Flag Incorrectly Set

**Location:** Line 496 in `unified_price_manager.py`
```python
processed_data["has_data"] = bool(processed_data.get("interval_prices"))
```

**Problem:** Only checks today's prices, ignores tomorrow's prices.

This affects the coordinator's validation at line 656:
```python
if not data.get("has_data"):
    # Treats as failure even if we have tomorrow's prices
```

---

## What's Working Correctly

✅ **API fetching** - ENTSO-E API returns correct data
✅ **Parsing** - ENTSOE parser extracts all 96 intervals correctly  
✅ **Timezone conversion** - Properly converts UTC to Stockholm time
✅ **Date splitting** - Correctly separates today/tomorrow based on dates
✅ **Data processor** - Generates complete processed data structure
✅ **Data validity calculation** - Correctly reports `has_current=False` for tomorrow-only data
✅ **Rate limiting** - Properly prevents excessive API calls
✅ **Midnight special window** - Allows fetch at 00:00-01:00

---

## What's Broken

❌ **Data validation** - Rejects valid tomorrow-only data
❌ **Cache storage** - Never stores data due to validation failure
❌ **Midnight transition** - Can't find yesterday's tomorrow data (not cached)
❌ **has_data flag** - Doesn't account for tomorrow-only scenarios

## The Fix (Already Applied)

### Fix 1: Line 382 - Accept Today OR Tomorrow
```python
# OLD (broken):
if processed_data and processed_data.get("has_data") and processed_data.get("interval_prices"):

# NEW (fixed):
has_today = processed_data and processed_data.get("interval_prices")
has_tomorrow = processed_data and processed_data.get("tomorrow_interval_prices")
has_valid_data = has_today or has_tomorrow

if processed_data and has_valid_data and "error" not in processed_data:
```

### Fix 2: Line 496 - Set has_data for Today OR Tomorrow  
```python
# OLD (broken):
processed_data["has_data"] = bool(processed_data.get("interval_prices"))

# NEW (fixed):
has_today = bool(processed_data.get("interval_prices"))
has_tomorrow = bool(processed_data.get("tomorrow_interval_prices"))
processed_data["has_data"] = has_today or has_tomorrow
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

**23:45-23:59 (Late Evening)**
1. API returns tomorrow's data (96 intervals for Oct 3)
2. Parser extracts: 0 today, 96 tomorrow ✅
3. Validation accepts: has_tomorrow=True ✅
4. Data cached successfully ✅
5. Sensors show "tomorrow" data in attributes ✅

**00:00 (Midnight)**
1. New day begins (Oct 3)
2. Cache manager finds yesterday's (Oct 2) tomorrow data ✅
3. Reprocesses: 96 prices become today's prices ✅
4. Sensors update with current prices ✅

**Throughout the Day**
1. System works with today's cached data
2. Around 13:00-14:00, API releases tomorrow's data
3. System caches tomorrow's prices for next midnight

---

## No Other Issues Found

The rest of the system appears to be functioning correctly:
- Exchange rate updates work
- Timezone calculations are accurate
- Interval calculator properly rounds to 15-minute intervals
- DST handling is correct (no transitions in Oct 2-3)
- Sensors properly request data from coordinator
- Error messages are helpful and accurate

---

## Testing Recommendations

After applying the fix:

1. **Clear cache and restart** at ~23:45
   - Verify tomorrow's data is accepted and cached
   - Check sensors show tomorrow prices in attributes

2. **Wait for midnight**
   - Verify yesterday's tomorrow becomes today
   - Check sensors show current prices

3. **Test normal hours** (morning/afternoon)
   - Verify today's data works normally
   - Check both today and tomorrow when available

4. **Monitor logs** for:
   - "Successfully processed data. Today: X, Tomorrow: Y"
   - Cache storage confirmation
   - No rejection errors
