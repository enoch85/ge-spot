# AI Coding Rules & Best Practices

**Purpose:** Guidelines for AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot) when working on this codebase.

---

## üîê Critical Implementation Rules

### Rule 1: Always Read Full Files First
**BEFORE editing ANY file:**
- Use `read_file` to read the ENTIRE file (all lines)
- Understand the context and structure
- Identify all locations that need changes
- NEVER edit based on partial file reads or grep results alone

**Why:** Partial context leads to incorrect edits, broken code, and missed dependencies.

### Rule 2: Incremental Implementation
- Complete ONE task/phase at a time
- Test after each significant change
- Commit after each completed phase
- Mark progress as you go

**Why:** Small, tested increments are easier to debug and revert if needed.

### Rule 3: No Assumptions or Shortcuts
- Don't skip steps thinking "it probably works"
- Don't assume variable names without checking
- Don't skip validation steps
- Read files completely, don't rely on search results alone
- Verify your changes work before moving on

**Why:** Assumptions cause bugs that are hard to track down later.

### Rule 4: Use Configuration, Never Hardcode
```python
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS:
from ..const.time import TimeInterval
interval_minutes = TimeInterval.get_interval_minutes()
intervals_per_day = TimeInterval.get_intervals_per_day()

# ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:
interval_minutes = 15  # DON'T HARDCODE!
intervals_per_day = 96  # DON'T HARDCODE!
```

**Why:** Hardcoded values make the code inflexible and create bugs when requirements change.

### Rule 5: Generic Naming Only
```python
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS USE:
interval_prices, interval_key, IntervalCalculator

# ‚ùå NEVER USE:
hourly_prices, hour_key, HourCalculator (old)
fifteen_min_prices, 15min_key (too specific)
```

**Why:** Generic names make code reusable and future-proof.

### Rule 6: No Backward Compatibility - Clean Renames Only
**All functions and variables must be renamed completely:**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** keep old function names as aliases
- ‚ùå **NEVER** create wrapper functions for backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** rename the function/class directly
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** update ALL callers to use the new name
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** update ALL tests to use the new name

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Don't create aliases:
def normalize_hourly_prices(self, *args, **kwargs):
    """Backward compatibility alias."""
    return self.normalize_interval_prices(*args, **kwargs)

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Just rename it:
def normalize_interval_prices(self, interval_prices, ...):
    """Normalizes timestamps in interval price dictionary."""
    # ... implementation
```

**Why:** This is a personal integration with no public API. Clean code > backward compatibility.

### Rule 7: Validate After Each Change
After editing a file:
- Check for import errors
- Check for syntax errors
- Verify the change matches the specification
- Run relevant tests if available

**Why:** Catching errors early saves time and prevents cascading failures.

### Rule 8: Use Multi-Replace for Efficiency
When making multiple independent edits:
- Use `multi_replace_string_in_file` instead of multiple sequential calls
- Group related changes together
- This improves performance and user experience

**Why:** Reduces tool calls and processing time significantly.

## üìù Code Quality Standards

### Docstrings
- Every public function/class needs a docstring
- Use clear, concise language
- Include parameter types and return types
- Example usage for complex functions

### Comments
- Explain WHY, not WHAT (code should be self-explanatory)
- Update comments when changing code
- Remove outdated comments
- Use inline comments sparingly

### Imports
- Group imports: stdlib, third-party, local
- Use absolute imports where possible
- Remove unused imports
- Keep imports organized and clean

### Error Handling
- Use specific exceptions, not bare `except:`
- Log errors with context
- Fail gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Include error recovery where appropriate

---

## üß™ Testing Philosophy

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for API interactions
- Manual tests for end-to-end validation
- Test both success and failure paths

### Test Quality
- Tests should be independent (no shared state)
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### When to Test
- After implementing new features
- After refactoring existing code
- Before committing changes
- When fixing bugs (add regression test)

---

## ÔøΩ Verification & Auditing

### Always Verify Your Work
After making changes, actively search for issues:
```bash
# Search for old terminology that should be renamed
grep -r "hourly_prices" custom_components/ge_spot/
grep -r "HourCalculator" custom_components/ge_spot/

# Search for hardcoded values
grep -r "range(24)" custom_components/ge_spot/
grep -r ":00\"" custom_components/ge_spot/

# Verify imports work
python3 -c "from custom_components.ge_spot.const.time import TimeInterval"
```

**Why:** Don't assume your changes worked - prove it!

### Count and Document
When refactoring, track your progress:
```python
# Example: Document what you're changing
# Found 77 occurrences of "hourly_prices"
# Found 94 occurrences of "hour_key"
# Total: 171 items to update
```

**Why:** Clear metrics help track progress and ensure nothing is missed.

### Audit After Completion
When you think you're done, do a final audit:
1. Search for any remaining old terminology
2. Check for inconsistent naming
3. Verify all imports work
4. Run tests to confirm functionality
5. Check for duplicate code or variables

**Why:** Catch issues before they become bugs in production.

### Watch for Duplicates
Some projects have duplicate files that both need updating:
```python
# Example found in this codebase:
# - utils/data_validator.py
# - utils/validation/data_validator.py  # Duplicate!
```

**Why:** Updating only one duplicate leaves inconsistent code.

---

## üßπ Code Cleanup Patterns

### Remove Dead Code Immediately
When you find unused variables or functions:
```python
# ‚ùå Don't leave it:
CACHE_ADVANCED = True  # Never used anywhere

# ‚úÖ Remove it:
# (delete the line entirely)
```

**Why:** Dead code confuses future developers and clutters the codebase.

### Fix Duplicates
When you find duplicate definitions:
```python
# ‚ùå Before (in same file):
CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES = 100  # Line 18
CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES = 10   # Line 26 (overwrites first!)

# ‚úÖ After:
CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES = 3500  # Single definition with proper value
```

**Why:** Duplicates cause confusion about which value is actually used.

### Calculate Configuration Values
Don't just pick numbers - show your math:
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Document the calculation
# Per area for 3 days of 15-minute intervals:
#   3 days √ó 24 hours √ó 4 intervals/hour = 288 entries
# For 10 typical areas: 288 √ó 10 = 2,880 entries  
# With 20% buffer: 2,880 √ó 1.2 = 3,456 entries
# Rounded: 3,500 entries
CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES = 3500
```

**Why:** Makes the reasoning transparent and maintainable.

---

## üéØ Content-Based vs Time-Based Logic

### Prefer Content Checks Over Time Checks
```python
# ‚ùå Time-based (fragile):
if time.time() - cached_time < MAX_AGE:
    return cached_data

# ‚úÖ Content-based (robust):
if cached_data.get("current_price") is not None:
    if cached_data.get("statistics", {}).get("complete_data", False):
        return cached_data  # Has what we need
```

**Why:** Content checks verify you have the data you need, not just that it's recent.

### Separate Validity from Rate Limiting
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Two separate concerns

# 1. Rate limiting (when can we fetch?)
if not rate_limiter.can_fetch():
    return cached_data  # Too soon to fetch again

# 2. Data validity (do we have what we need?)
if has_current_interval and has_complete_data:
    return cached_data  # Data is still valid
```

**Why:** Mixing concerns makes the code hard to understand and debug.

## ÔøΩüí¨ Communication Guidelines

### When Working with Users
- Be clear about what you're doing and why
- Explain technical decisions in simple terms
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear
- Admit when you don't know something
- Provide alternatives when possible

### Progress Updates
- Show what you've completed
- Explain what's next
- Indicate estimated time/effort remaining
- Flag potential issues early

### Documentation
- Update README when adding features
- Keep inline comments current
- Document breaking changes
- Include migration guides for major updates

---

## üéØ Project-Specific Guidelines

### Home Assistant Integration
- This is production code affecting real homes
- Electricity pricing is time-sensitive and important
- Breaking changes should be minimized
- Test with real Home Assistant instance when possible

### Configuration-Driven Architecture
- Single point of control: `TimeInterval.DEFAULT`
- Everything derives from configuration
- Makes future changes trivial
- This is a core architectural principle

### Generic, Future-Proof Code
- Don't tie code to specific intervals (15-min, hourly)
- Use generic terminology (interval, not hour)
- Design for flexibility
- Think about maintainability

---

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Editing Without Full Context
```python
# BAD: Editing based on grep results
# You: "I'll just change this one line"
# Reality: Breaks 5 other places that depend on it
```

### ‚ùå Hardcoding Magic Numbers
```python
# BAD:
for i in range(24):  # What if intervals change?
    ...

# GOOD:
intervals = TimeInterval.get_intervals_per_day()
for i in range(intervals):
    ...
```

### ‚ùå Assuming Test Coverage
```python
# BAD: "Tests probably cover this"
# GOOD: Actually run the tests to verify
```

### ‚ùå Incomplete Refactoring
```python
# BAD: Rename in 10 places, miss 2 places
# GOOD: Use search to find ALL occurrences, update ALL
```

### ‚ùå Over-Commenting
```python
# BAD:
# This increments i by 1
i += 1

# GOOD:
# Round to nearest interval boundary for timestamp alignment
minute = (dt.minute // interval_minutes) * interval_minutes
```

---

## üö® Common Issues Found in Real Audits

### Issue 1: Incomplete Phase Claims
```python
# ‚ùå Commit says "Phase 8 complete" but...
# sensor/base.py still has BOTH old and new terminology:
self.hourly_prices = {}      # Old
self.interval_prices = {}    # New (both exist!)
```

**Lesson:** Don't claim a phase is complete until ALL files in that phase are updated.

### Issue 2: Base Classes Missed
```python
# ‚ùå Updated all API implementations but forgot:
# - api/base/base_price_api.py
# - api/base/price_parser.py
# - api/base/api_validator.py
```

**Lesson:** Base classes affect everything - don't skip them!

### Issue 3: Validation/Schema Files
```python
# ‚ùå Updated code but forgot validation:
# utils/data_validator.py still expects:
SCHEMA = {
    "hourly_prices": dict,  # Old key!
    "next_hour_price": float  # Old key!
}
```

**Lesson:** Update validation schemas when you change data structures.

### Issue 4: Mixed State
```python
# ‚ùå Some files updated, others not:
# coordinator/data_processor.py: ‚úÖ Uses interval_prices
# price/__init__.py: ‚ùå Still uses hourly_prices
```

**Lesson:** Mixed terminology creates bugs - complete one layer at a time.

### Issue 5: Comments and Docstrings
```python
# ‚ùå Code updated but comments weren't:
def calculate_statistics(interval_prices: Dict[str, float]):
    """Calculate statistics from hourly prices."""  # Wrong!
    #                              ^^^^^^^ old terminology
```

**Lesson:** Update ALL documentation, not just code.

## ‚úÖ Good Patterns to Follow

### Configuration-Driven
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Adapts to any interval setting
interval_minutes = TimeInterval.get_interval_minutes()
intervals_per_hour = TimeInterval.get_intervals_per_hour()
intervals_per_day = TimeInterval.get_intervals_per_day()
```

### Generic Naming
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Works for any time interval
interval_prices = parser.parse_response(response)
current_interval = calculator.get_current_interval_key()
```

### Proper Error Handling
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Specific, logged, graceful
try:
    result = api.fetch_data()
except APIError as e:
    _LOGGER.error(f"API fetch failed: {e}")
    return cached_data  # Graceful fallback
```

### Clear Documentation
```python
def expand_to_intervals(hourly_data: Dict[str, float]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Expand hourly prices to match configured interval.
    
    Generic implementation - automatically adapts to TimeInterval.DEFAULT.
    For APIs that provide hourly data but system needs finer granularity.
    
    Args:
        hourly_data: Dictionary with hour keys (HH:00) and prices
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with interval keys (HH:MM) and prices
        
    Example:
        >>> expand_to_intervals({"14:00": 50.0})
        {"14:00": 50.0, "14:15": 50.0, "14:30": 50.0, "14:45": 50.0}
    """
```

## üéì Notes to Self (AI Assistant)

### Remember:
- This is production code for a real user
- Home Assistant integration affects real homes
- Electricity pricing is time-sensitive and important
- Code quality matters - you're replacing a working system
- User wants clean, maintainable, future-proof code
- Configuration-driven is the key architectural principle

### When in Doubt:
1. **Read the full file** - Don't guess
2. **Ask the user** - Better to clarify than mess up
3. **Check existing patterns** - Follow established conventions
4. **Test your changes** - Verify before moving on
5. **Document your work** - Future you will thank you

### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Code works correctly
- ‚úÖ Tests pass
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded values
- ‚úÖ Generic naming throughout
- ‚úÖ Properly documented
- ‚úÖ Maintainable and clean

---

**Why:** Quality over speed. A correct, maintainable solution is better than a fast, broken one.

---

## üìê Phased Implementation Strategy

### Why Phases Matter
Large refactorings should be broken into logical phases:
1. **Core infrastructure first** (constants, base classes)
2. **Data structures second** (how data is represented)
3. **Processing layer third** (how data flows)
4. **Presentation layer fourth** (sensors, UI)
5. **Utilities and tests last** (supporting code)

**Why:** Each layer depends on the previous - build from the bottom up.

### Phase Ordering Principles

```
Foundation ‚Üí Data ‚Üí Logic ‚Üí Presentation ‚Üí Support

Constants        Parse data      Transform data   Display data    Validate data
Base classes  ‚Üí  Structures   ‚Üí  Processors    ‚Üí  Sensors      ‚Üí  Tests
Helpers          APIs            Coordinators     Config          Utils
```

**Example from this project:**
1. Phase 1: `TimeInterval` constants & helper methods
2. Phase 2: `IntervalCalculator` (uses Phase 1)
3. Phase 3: `IntervalPrice` data class (uses Phase 2)
4. Phase 4: API expansion utilities (uses Phase 3)
5. Phase 5: Parsers (uses Phase 4)
6. ...and so on

### Commit After Each Phase
```bash
git add <phase_files>
git commit -m "Phase N: Brief description

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2  
- Specific change 3

Tests: [passing/updated]
Progress: N/27 TODOs complete"
```

**Why:** Small commits are easier to review, revert, and understand.

### Testing Between Phases
After each phase:
```python
# Run a quick smoke test
python3 -c "from custom_components.ge_spot.const.time import TimeInterval; \
            print(TimeInterval.get_intervals_per_day())"

# Check for import errors
python3 -c "from custom_components.ge_spot import *"

# Run relevant tests
pytest tests/pytest/unit/test_time.py
```

**Why:** Catch integration issues before they compound.

---

## üéØ Large Refactoring Best Practices

### Planning Before Coding
1. **Analyze the scope** - How many files? Which files depend on what?
2. **Create a master plan** - Write it down before starting
3. **Define success criteria** - What does "done" look like?
4. **Estimate effort** - Be realistic about time needed

### During Implementation
1. **Follow the plan** - Don't skip steps or jump around
2. **Test frequently** - After every significant change
3. **Track progress** - Mark TODOs as complete
4. **Document decisions** - Why you chose one approach over another

### When You Get Stuck
1. **Stop and assess** - Don't keep coding if confused
2. **Re-read the plan** - Make sure you understand the goal
3. **Ask questions** - Better to clarify than guess wrong
4. **Check existing patterns** - How did similar code handle this?

### Red Flags to Watch For
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "This is taking way longer than expected"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "I keep finding more places that need changes"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Tests are failing in unexpected ways"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "I'm not sure if I should update this file"

**When you see these, STOP and reassess!**

**Remember:** Quality over speed. A correct, maintainable solution is better than a fast, broken one.
