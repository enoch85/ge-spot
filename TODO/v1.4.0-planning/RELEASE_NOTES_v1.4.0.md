# Release Notes: GE-Spot v1.4.0

**Release Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Type:** Performance & Reliability Release  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes (State Class Removal - see below)

---

## üö® BREAKING CHANGE: State Class Removed

### What Changed

As part of [PR #18](https://github.com/enoch85/ge-spot/pull/18) (merged in v1.3.4-beta4), we removed the `state_class` attribute from all price sensors to comply with Home Assistant's requirements for the `MONETARY` device class.

### What You'll See

After upgrading to v1.4.0, Home Assistant may show this notification for each price sensor:

![State Class Warning](screenshot_state_class_warning.png)

**Example message:**
```
The entity sensor.gespot_tomorrow_average_price_se3 no longer has a state class

We have generated statistics for 'GE-Spot Tomorrow Average Price SE3' 
(sensor.gespot_tomorrow_average_price_se3) in the past, but it no longer 
has a state class, therefore we cannot track long term statistics for 
it anymore.

Do you want to permanently delete the long term statistics of 
sensor.gespot_tomorrow_average_price_se3 from your database?
```

### What to Do

**Click "Delete"** for each sensor showing this warning. This is expected and safe.

**Why This Change?**
- Home Assistant's `MONETARY` device class is incompatible with `state_class` for statistical aggregation
- The previous setup caused validation warnings and potential issues with long-term statistics
- Your price history is still recorded (default: 10 days, configurable via `recorder.purge_keep_days`)
- This brings GE-Spot into compliance with [Home Assistant's sensor documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/)

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Price history still available in dashboards
- ‚úÖ Short-term trends still visible (configurable retention)
- ‚ùå Long-term statistical aggregation no longer tracked by HA

## ‚ö° Performance Improvements

### CRITICAL: Cache Processed Results (97.6% Faster!)

**The Problem We Fixed:**

GE-Spot was reprocessing cached data on **every sensor update** (~10 seconds), even though the data hadn't changed. This meant:

- **396+ unnecessary reprocessing operations** in just 11 minutes
- Full timezone normalization (96-192 timestamps)
- Complete currency conversion (96-192 prices)
- Statistics recalculation (min/max/avg)
- **~207 minutes of CPU time wasted per day** üî•

**The Solution:**

Cache now stores **fully processed** data instead of raw data:

```
BEFORE (every ~10 seconds):
Retrieve cache ‚Üí Normalize 192 timestamps ‚Üí Convert 192 prices ‚Üí 
Calculate statistics ‚Üí Find current/next ‚Üí Return
‚è±Ô∏è ~4ms per operation

AFTER (every ~10 seconds):
Retrieve cache ‚Üí Update current/next interval only ‚Üí Return
‚è±Ô∏è ~0.1ms per operation (40x faster!)
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **97.6% reduction** in cache processing time
- ‚úÖ **~202 minutes of CPU time saved per day**
- ‚úÖ Significantly reduced CPU usage, especially for multi-area setups
- ‚úÖ Faster sensor updates
- ‚úÖ Lower energy consumption

**Technical Details:**
- Processed data includes normalized prices, calculated statistics, converted currencies
- Fast-path update only recalculates current/next interval (changes every 15 minutes)
- Configuration changes (VAT, currency, display unit) still trigger full reprocessing
- Automatic migration from old cache format (no manual action required)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### MODERATE: Health Check Now Runs in Both Special Windows

**The Problem We Fixed:**

The health check system had a critical flaw: it only ran **once per day**, even though we have **two special windows**:
- **00:00-01:00** - For fetching today's new prices
- **13:00-15:00** - For fetching tomorrow's prices

**What This Meant:**
- If health check ran at 00:00, it **wouldn't run again** at 13:00 the same day
- Failed sources stayed disabled for **11+ hours** until the next day
- The critical 13:00-15:00 window (for tomorrow's data) couldn't recover failed sources
- Users missed tomorrow's prices from sources that had recovered

**The Solution:**

Health check now tracks **per-window** instead of **per-day**:

```
BEFORE:
00:05 - Health check runs ‚úì
      - _last_check_date = today
13:00 - Health check skips ‚úó (already ran today)
      - Failed sources NOT validated
      - Tomorrow's data unavailable
      
AFTER:
00:05 - Health check runs ‚úì (window 0)
      - _checked_windows_today = {0}
13:10 - Health check runs ‚úì (window 13)
      - _checked_windows_today = {0, 13}
      - Failed sources validated!
      - Tomorrow's data available
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Failed sources validated **twice daily** (in both special windows)
- ‚úÖ Maximum **2-hour wait** for source recovery (was 11+ hours)
- ‚úÖ Tomorrow's prices available from recovered sources
- ‚úÖ Better source redundancy and reliability

**Technical Details:**
- Tracks which window start hours have been checked today (`{0, 13}`)
- Clears tracking set at midnight for new day
- Reduced sleep interval to 15 minutes (was 1 hour) for faster window detection
- Log messages now show which window is running

### MINOR: Removed Redundant Cache Lookup Logging

**The Problem We Fixed:**

Cache manager logged `"No specific source hit for 'None'"` on every cache retrieval when no source was specified. This was:
- Expected behavior (not an error)
- Logged **36 times per minute** per area
- Created log spam

**The Solution:**

Only log when actual fallback occurs (source was specified but not found).

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Cleaner logs
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging
- ‚úÖ Same functionality

## üìù Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v1.3.x

**Step 1: Backup (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
# Backup your Home Assistant configuration
# (Standard HA backup process)
```

**Step 2: Upgrade**
```bash
# Via HACS:
1. Go to HACS ‚Üí Integrations
2. Find "GE-Spot"
3. Click "Update"

# Or manually:
cd /config/custom_components/ge_spot
git pull
git checkout v1.4.0
```

**Step 3: Restart Home Assistant**
```bash
# Restart Home Assistant to load new version
```

**Step 4: Handle State Class Warnings**

You'll see warnings like this for each price sensor:

```
The entity sensor.gespot_tomorrow_average_price_se3 no longer has a state class
```

**Click "Delete"** on each notification. This is expected and safe.

**Step 5: Verify**

Check logs for:
```
Successfully processed data for area X. ... Cached: True
Fast-path cache update: current=X, next=Y
Daily health check starting in Xs (window: 00:00-01:00 OR 13:00-15:00)
```

**That's it!** The upgrade is automatic. After the first sensor update cycle, you'll see performance improvements.
