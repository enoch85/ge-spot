# Release Notes: GE-Spot v1.4.0

**Release Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Type:** Reliability & User Experience Release  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes (State Class Removal - see below)

---

## üö® BREAKING CHANGE: State Class Removed

### What Changed

As part of [PR #18](https://github.com/enoch85/ge-spot/pull/18) (merged in v1.3.4-beta4), we removed the `state_class` attribute from all price sensors to comply with Home Assistant's requirements for the `MONETARY` device class.

### What You'll See

After upgrading to v1.4.0, Home Assistant may show this notification for each price sensor:

![State Class Warning](screenshot_state_class_warning.png)

**Example message:**
```
The entity sensor.gespot_tomorrow_average_price_se3 no longer has a state class

We have generated statistics for 'GE-Spot Tomorrow Average Price SE3' 
(sensor.gespot_tomorrow_average_price_se3) in the past, but it no longer 
has a state class, therefore we cannot track long term statistics for 
it anymore.

Do you want to permanently delete the long term statistics of 
sensor.gespot_tomorrow_average_price_se3 from your database?
```

### What to Do

**Click "Delete"** for each sensor showing this warning. This is expected and safe.

**Why This Change?**
- Home Assistant's `MONETARY` device class is incompatible with `state_class` for statistical aggregation
- The previous setup caused validation warnings and potential issues with long-term statistics
- Your price history is still recorded (default: 10 days, configurable via `recorder.purge_keep_days`)
- This brings GE-Spot into compliance with [Home Assistant's sensor documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/)

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Price history still available in dashboards
- ‚úÖ Short-term trends still visible (configurable retention)
- ‚ùå Long-term statistical aggregation no longer tracked by HA

## ‚ö° Reliability Improvements

### NEW: Grace Period After Restart (Immediate Data Recovery)

**The Problem We Solved:**

After Home Assistant restart or integration reload, sensors would show "unavailable" for up to 15 minutes due to rate limiting, even though this is a normal operation.

**The Solution:**

Implemented a **5-minute grace period** after coordinator creation that allows immediate data fetching:

```
BEFORE (without grace period):
00:00 - HA restarts
00:01 - First update: Rate limited (last fetch was 2 min ago) ‚ùå
        Sensors show "unavailable" for 15 minutes

AFTER (with grace period):
00:00 - HA restarts
00:01 - First update: Grace period active, bypasses rate limit ‚úÖ
        Sensors show fresh data immediately
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Sensors show data within seconds** after HA restart
- ‚úÖ **Better user experience** during common operations (restart/reload)
- ‚úÖ **No error messages** during expected post-restart behavior
- ‚úÖ **Automations see valid data** immediately, not "unavailable"
- ‚úÖ **Configuration changes reflected instantly** (VAT, currency, etc.)

**Technical Details:**
- Grace period: 5 minutes after coordinator creation
- Only bypasses rate limiting, still respects data validity checks
- Documented in: `improvements/GRACE_PERIOD_MECHANISM.md`

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### CRITICAL: Health Check Now Runs in Both Special Windows

**The Problem We Fixed:**

The health check system had a critical flaw: it only ran **once per day**, even though we have **two special windows**:
- **00:00-01:00** - For fetching today's new prices
- **13:00-15:00** - For fetching tomorrow's prices

**What This Meant:**
- If health check ran at 00:00, it **wouldn't run again** at 13:00 the same day
- Failed sources stayed disabled for **11+ hours** until the next day
- The critical 13:00-15:00 window (for tomorrow's data) couldn't recover failed sources
- Users missed tomorrow's prices from sources that had recovered

**The Solution:**

Health check now tracks **per-window** instead of **per-day**:

```
BEFORE (buggy behavior):
00:05 - Health check runs ‚úì
      - _last_check_date = today
13:00 - Health check skips ‚úó (already ran today)
      - Failed sources NOT validated
      - Tomorrow's data unavailable
      
AFTER (fixed behavior):
00:05 - Health check runs ‚úì (window 0)
      - _last_check_window = 0
13:10 - Health check runs ‚úì (window 13)
      - _last_check_window = 13
      - Failed sources validated!
      - Tomorrow's data available
00:00 - Next day (window 0)
      - Compares: 13 != 0 ‚Üí runs again ‚úì
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Failed sources validated **twice daily** (in both special windows)
- ‚úÖ Maximum **2-hour wait** for source recovery (was 11+ hours)
- ‚úÖ Tomorrow's prices available from recovered sources
- ‚úÖ Better source redundancy and reliability

**Technical Details:**
- Tracks last checked window start hour: `_last_check_window` (stores 0 or 13)
- Window comparison: `current_window_start != _last_check_window` allows both windows same day
- Reduced sleep interval to **15 minutes** (900s, was 3600s) for faster window detection
- Log messages now show which window is running
- Automatically resets for new day (window 0 != 13 comparison)

### MINOR: Removed Redundant Cache Lookup Logging

**The Problem We Fixed:**

Cache manager logged `"No specific source hit for 'None'"` on every cache retrieval when no source was specified. This was:
- Expected behavior (not an error)
- Logged **36 times per minute** per area
- Created log spam

**The Solution:**

Only log when actual fallback occurs (source was specified but not found).

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Cleaner logs
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging
- ‚úÖ Same functionality

- Window comparison logic allows both windows to run same day
- 15-minute sleep interval ensures windows aren't missed
- Better logging with window information

**Specific Error Types:**
- `NO_SOURCES_CONFIGURED` - Permanent configuration issue
- `ALL_SOURCES_DISABLED` - Temporary (all sources failed recently)
- `INVALID_AREA_CODE` - Invalid area configuration
- `VALIDATION_FAILED` - Data validation errors
- `INCOMPLETE_DATA` - Partial data received

### Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes (except state class from PR #18):**
- Grace period activates automatically on first coordinator creation
- Per-window health checks work with existing configuration
- No manual intervention required
- All existing automations continue to work

‚úÖ **Configuration Changes:**
- VAT rate changes ‚Üí Triggers new fetch during grace period
- Currency changes ‚Üí Triggers new fetch during grace period
- Display unit changes ‚Üí Triggers new fetch during grace period
- Area changes ‚Üí Creates new coordinator with new grace period

## üß™ Testing

All existing tests pass:
- ‚úÖ **191 unit tests** (all passing after consecutive failures counter fix)
- ‚úÖ Grace period mechanism tested (bypass rate limiting during 5-minute window)
- ‚úÖ Per-window health check behavior verified (runs in both 0 and 13 windows)
- ‚úÖ Error type system validated (specific error codes in sensor attributes)
- ‚úÖ Config change behavior tested (new coordinator creation triggers grace period)

**Manual Testing:**
- ‚úÖ Grace period activates immediately after HA restart
- ‚úÖ Sensors show data within seconds of restart (not 15 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Health check runs in both windows same day (00:00-01:00 and 13:00-15:00)
- ‚úÖ Failed source recovery in second window verified
- ‚úÖ Error codes properly exposed in sensor attributes
- ‚úÖ Consecutive failures counter increments correctly

## üìù Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v1.3.x

**Step 1: Backup (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
# Backup your Home Assistant configuration
# (Standard HA backup process)
```

**Step 2: Upgrade**
```bash
# Via HACS:
1. Go to HACS ‚Üí Integrations
2. Find "GE-Spot"
3. Click "Update"

# Or manually:
cd /config/custom_components/ge_spot
git pull
git checkout v1.4.0
```

**Step 3: Restart Home Assistant**
```bash
# Restart Home Assistant to load new version
```

**Step 4: Observe Grace Period in Action**

After restart, check your logs - you should see:
```
INFO: [SE1] Data will update within 15 minutes (rate limit protection 
      active after configuration reload)
```

Sensors will show fresh data within seconds, not minutes!

**Step 5: Handle State Class Warnings**

You'll see warnings like this for each price sensor:

```
The entity sensor.gespot_tomorrow_average_price_se3 no longer has a state class
```

**Click "Delete"** on each notification. This is expected and safe.

**Step 6: Verify**

Check logs for:
```
INFO: [SE1] Data will update within 15 minutes (rate limit protection 
      active after configuration reload)
INFO: [SE1] Daily health check starting in Xs (window: 00:00-01:00 OR 13:00-15:00)
DEBUG: Rate limiting [SE1]: ALLOWING fetch - Within grace period after 
       startup - bypassing rate limiting
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Sensors showing data within seconds of restart
- ‚úÖ Grace period logs during first 5 minutes after restart
- ‚úÖ Health checks running in both daily windows
- ‚úÖ Error codes in sensor attributes (Developer Tools ‚Üí States)

**That's it!** The upgrade is automatic and all improvements activate immediately.
