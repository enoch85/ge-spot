# Integration Test Status Report

_Last updated: October 2, 2025_

## Summary

- All manual "full chain" scripts and pytest integration suites now operate on `interval_raw` payloads and call `normalize_interval_prices()`, aligning them with the 15-minute migration naming.
- Key regressions that previously destroyed 5-minute source data (ComEd and AEMO) have been fixed; aggregation now produces accurate 15-minute intervals before tests execute assertions.
- The stand-alone migration verification script (`tests/test_15min_migration.py`) passes when the repository root is on `PYTHONPATH`, providing a comprehensive smoke test for interval helpers, parsers, and aggregation utilities.
- Integration coverage still bypasses the production `DataProcessor` path; tests invoke parser outputs directly. This keeps regression coverage for data conversions but does not exercise the full Home Assistant flow yet.

## Timeline of Fixes

1. **Initial audit – incorrect helpers (Oct 1, 2025)**  
   `INTEGRATION_TEST_FIXES.md` documented that manual integration runs were still using `normalize_hourly_prices()` and reconstructing production behavior ad hoc.

2. **Method swap across manual scripts (Oct 1, 2025)**  
   `INTEGRATION_TEST_FIXES_COMPLETED.md` replaced `normalize_hourly_prices()` with `normalize_interval_prices()` across all eight manual full-chain scripts, restoring 15-minute awareness.

3. **Key rename rollout (Oct 1, 2025)**  
   `INTEGRATION_TEST_KEY_FIXES.md` and `ALL_INTEGRATION_TEST_FIXES_COMPLETED.md` tracked the migration from `hourly_raw`/`hourly_prices` to `interval_raw` in both manual and pytest suites.

4. **Follow-up audit (Oct 1, 2025)**  
   `INTEGRATION_TEST_AUDIT_STATUS.md` and `TEST_REFERENCE_AUDIT.md` identified lingering references (Energi Data, Stromligning, and pytest live tests). Those references have since been removed in the current branch (`grep` confirms no active `hourly_prices` usage under `tests/pytest/integration`).

5. **Validation sweep (Oct 1–2, 2025)**  
   `TEST_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` captured green runs for the scripted migration suites. Re-running today with `PYTHONPATH=/workspaces/ge-spot` confirms the comprehensive migration script succeeds end to end.

## Remaining Issues

- **Production path parity:** Integration tests still orchestrate parsers manually instead of invoking `coordinator.DataProcessor.process()`. Migrating the suites to the production flow remains the top follow-up so tests can detect coordinator regressions automatically.
- **Manual API diagnostics:** The helper scripts under `tests/manual/api/` retain `hourly_raw` fallbacks for legacy scraping; investigate whether those should be upgraded or deprecated alongside the wider cleanup.
- **Automation ergonomics:** `tests/test_15min_migration.py` is a standalone script rather than a pytest suite; contributors must export `PYTHONPATH` before running it or adapt it into pytest-formatted tests for CI friendliness.

## Final Validation

| Check | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Comprehensive migration script | `PYTHONPATH=/workspaces/ge-spot python tests/test_15min_migration.py` | ✅ All eight stages pass (configuration helpers, interval calculator, parser aggregation, naming guarantees) |
| Pytest discovery sanity | `python -m pytest tests/pytest/integration` | ⚠️ Not yet re-run in this session; expected to exercise live API stubs and may require network credentials |
| Manual full-chain smoke (example) | `python tests/manual/integration/nordpool_full_chain.py SE3 --no-cache` | ⚠️ Not executed today; use after ensuring API keys/quotas are available. Should report ~192 interval points (96 per day × 2) |

**Next Steps for QA**
- Refactor integration tests to rely on `DataProcessor` and record cached outputs rather than recomputing logic inline.
- Convert `tests/test_15min_migration.py` into pytest tests or wrap it with a helper script that injects `PYTHONPATH` automatically.
- Schedule a full manual test pass (all APIs) once the outstanding coordinator and utilities work completes, so the report can certify the end-to-end Home Assistant flow.
