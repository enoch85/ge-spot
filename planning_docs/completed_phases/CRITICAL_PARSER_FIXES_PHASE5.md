# Critical Parser Fixes - Phase 5 Complete

## Summary

Successfully fixed **2 critical data loss issues** where parsers were destroying fine-grained price data from APIs.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ComEd Parser ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** API provides 5-minute interval data, but parser was aggregating to hourly averages
- **Data Loss:** Losing 12x granularity (5-min → 60-min)
- **Impact:** Users missed detailed price variations within each hour

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed aggregation from hourly to 15-minute intervals
- Now averages 3x 5-minute prices per 15-minute interval
- Updated `_get_current_price()` and `_get_next_interval_price()` to use 15-minute rounding

**Code Changes:**
```python
# OLD (WRONG - hourly aggregation):
hour_dt = timestamp.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
hour_prices[interval_key].append(price)
avg_price = sum(prices) / len(prices)  # Average of all 5-min prices in hour (12 values)

# NEW (CORRECT - 15-minute aggregation):
minute_rounded = (timestamp.minute // 15) * 15
interval_dt = timestamp.replace(minute=minute_rounded, second=0, microsecond=0)
interval_15min_prices[interval_key].append(price)
avg_price = sum(prices) / len(prices)  # Average of 3x 5-min prices per 15-min interval
```

### 2. AEMO Parser ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** API provides 5-minute dispatch interval data, but parser was rounding all timestamps to the hour
- **Data Loss:** Destroying ALL timestamp resolution (5-min → 60-min with only 1 value kept)
- **Impact:** Users saw only 1 price per hour instead of actual 5-minute granularity

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `_aggregate_to_15min()` helper method
- Aggregates 5-minute prices to 15-minute intervals (average of 3 values)
- Updated `_parse_json()` and `_parse_csv()` to use aggregation
- Updated `_get_current_price()` and `_get_next_interval_price()` to use 15-minute rounding
- Removed destructive `.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)` logic

**Code Changes:**
```python
# OLD (WRONG - destroyed timestamp resolution):
current_hour = now.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)  # Lost all minute info!
current_interval_key = current_hour.isoformat()

# NEW (CORRECT - preserves 15-minute resolution):
minute_rounded = (now.minute // 15) * 15
current_interval = now.replace(minute=minute_rounded, second=0, microsecond=0)
current_interval_key = current_interval.isoformat()
```

**New Method Added:**
```python
def _aggregate_to_15min(self, prices_5min: Dict[str, float]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Aggregate 5-minute prices to 15-minute intervals.
    
    AEMO provides 5-minute dispatch prices, but we aggregate them to 15-minute intervals
    to match our target resolution. Each 15-minute interval is the average of 3x 5-minute prices.
    """
    # Implementation aggregates properly without losing data
```

## Validation

All parsers import successfully:
```bash
✅ All 9 parsers import successfully after critical fixes!
  - ComEd: Fixed 5-min → 15-min aggregation (was hourly)
  - AEMO: Fixed 5-min → 15-min aggregation (was hour-rounding)
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fixes:
- **ComEd:** 12x data loss (5-min → hourly)
- **AEMO:** Complete data destruction (5-min → hourly with single value)
- Users received inaccurate price information
- Integration did not reflect actual market price variations

### After Fixes:
- **ComEd:** Proper 15-minute averages from 5-minute data
- **AEMO:** Proper 15-minute averages from 5-minute data
- Users get accurate price information at 15-minute resolution
- Integration properly represents market dynamics

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Critical Fixes:** ComEd and AEMO parsers fixed
2. 🔧 **Expansion Needed:** OMIE, Stromligning, Energi Data (add `expand_to_intervals()` calls in API layer)
3. ⚠️ **Verification Needed:** Nord Pool (check if API now provides 15-min after MTU transition)
4. ⚠️ **Verification Needed:** EPEX (verify 15-minute timestamps handled correctly)
5. ✅ **No Changes Needed:** ENTSO-E (already correct), Amber (30-min is acceptable)

## Lessons Learned

**Critical Mistake Made:**
- Initially changed comments from "hourly" to "interval" without understanding the actual logic
- Comments like "hourly aggregation from 5-min data" were **descriptively correct** about what the code was doing
- Should have **changed the logic**, not just the terminology

**Correct Approach:**
1. Investigate what data the API actually provides
2. Understand what the current code does with that data
3. Determine what the code SHOULD do
4. Change the logic to match requirements
5. Update comments to reflect the new logic

**Key Insight:**
> When migrating to a new time resolution, you must understand the SOURCE data resolution first. You can't just rename variables - you must ensure the aggregation/expansion logic matches the data flow.
